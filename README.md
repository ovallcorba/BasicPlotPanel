# BasicPlotPanel

BasicPlotPanel is a plotting library that uses java jPanels and with the primary focus to X-ray powder diffraction data although it is ment to be generic enough for any application.

This was a personal closed source project started on 2015 and actively maintained until 2020. I made it open source in 2022 (sorry if the code is messy and for the comments in different languages).
