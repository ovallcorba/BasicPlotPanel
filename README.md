# BasicPlotPanel

BasicPlotPanel is a plotting library that uses java jPanels and with the primary focus to X-ray powder diffraction data although it is meant to be generic enough for any application. It started as [d1Dplot](https://github.com/ovallcorba/D1Dplot) and moved as an independent library at some point of the development. The library has also been used in non-powder diffraction plots, such as a [DCM glitch calculator](https://github.com/ovallcorba/DCM_Glitch_calculator).

This was a personal closed source project started on 2015 and actively maintained until 2020. From August 2022 the program is open source and licensed under the GPL-3.0 license. Sorry if the code is not following best practices, is a little bit messy and for the comments in catalan.
